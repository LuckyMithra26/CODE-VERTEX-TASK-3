# CODE-VERTEX-TASK-3
A Password Generator is a simple yet highly practical project that helps users generate strong and random passwords to enhance security. In this project, the application will prompt the user to specify the length of the password they want, and based on this input, it will generate a random password using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.

Key Features
User Input: The user specifies the length of the password they want.
Password Generation: The program generates a random password containing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
Password Display: The generated password is printed on the screen for the user to copy and use.
Customizability (Optional): The user can choose to include/exclude special characters or numbers based on their preference.

Code Breakdown
Importing Modules:

random: This module is used to generate random selections of characters.
string: This module contains a set of predefined character types such as ascii_letters, digits, and punctuation that we can use to form the password.
Password Generation Function (generate_password):

The function accepts one argument, length, which specifies how many characters the password should contain.
Character Pool: It defines the available characters for the password by combining:
string.ascii_letters: Both uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z).
string.digits: Numbers (0-9).
string.punctuation: Special characters (e.g., @, #, !).
It then generates a password by randomly selecting characters from this pool using random.choice(), which ensures each character is chosen independently.
Main Program Logic:

The user is prompted to input the length of the password.
If the length is less than 4 characters (a reasonable minimum for a strong password), a warning message is displayed.
Otherwise, the password generation function is called, and the result is printed to the console.
Example Execution:
Input: User specifies that they want a password of 10 characters.
Output: The program generates something like d7Jf@3P!Qs.
